Installation
============

The latest version can be installed via `TER`_ or via composer by running

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require friendsoftypo3/fontawesome-provider

in a TYPO3 v11+ installation.

.. _TER: https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/fontawesome_provider

Inside the logic
================

The class :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Imaging\IconProvider\FontawesomeIconProvider` is
extracted into a new namespace :php:`\FriendsOfTYPO3\FontawesomeProvider\Imaging\IconProvider\FontawesomeIconProvider::class`.

A Composer class map is in place which ensures compatibility when using the old
class name.

For compatibility reasons, this extension is installable in TYPO3 v11 already.
If installed in TYPO3 v12, additional CSS is loaded that provides the
:css:`fa-*` classes.

Current state
=============

The latest version here reflects a feature-complete state, and solely acts as a
compatibility layer for extensions and installations in need of this legacy
feature.

Contribution
============
